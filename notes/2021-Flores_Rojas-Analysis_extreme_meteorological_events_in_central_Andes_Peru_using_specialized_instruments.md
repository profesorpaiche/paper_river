- **Description:** Use of specialize instruments to record some extreme events
  (precipitation, frost and pollution) and analyze its behavior.

# Notes

- "WCRP Extremes Grand Challenge highlights four research themes: (a)
  documentation, which focus on the observational requirements, (b)
  understanding, with a focus on the relative roles of different spatial scales
  and their interactions, (c) simulations, focus on model reliability and
  improvements, and (d) attribute, with a focus on unraveling the contributions
  to extreme events".

- A broad description of the precipitation, starts during afternoon or evening
  due to moisture flux and mid-high western or eastern circulations. Also,
  a study using satellites was done to check precipitation evolution.

- Radiative frost is a problem for agriculture and it has been shown that Tmin
  depends on low cloud cover, specific humidity at surface and soil moisture.
  For cold surges, 3-4 are reported per year on average. This are characterized
  by low-level northward circulation with mid-low troposphere subsidence that
  reinforces the cooling by radiative effect.

- Aerosols comes mainly from biomass burning.
