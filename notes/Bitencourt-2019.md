# Notes

## Introduction

Many studies point towards and increase of warmer days and nights, and increase
of intensity and frequency of extreme temperatures around the world.

The summer heat events around midwest and southern Brazil are related with
a positive anomalies of geopotential height at mid troposphere (500 hPa),
followed by a warming in low troposphere (850 hPa). These changes are related to
the South Atlantic Subtropical High System, weakening of the ITCZ and SACZ.

Cold waves tend to occur between June and August due to the incursion of polar
air through cold fronts related to extra-tropical cyclones (it can be tracked).
"Extreme cold events ... are caused by intensified middle- and upper-level ridge
formation near the Andes and by strong southerly winds at the surface, which
carries the cold dry air towards the tropical latitudes." As a consequence of
this event, high surface pressure can be detect after the front event.

Also, these cold waves are stronger in high altitudes and increases the risk of
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. On the other hand, heat waves have more
consequences in large cities due to the urban heat island effect.

> The mention of high altitudes being more susceptible to the consequences of
cold waves is important to analyze.

## Data and methods

"Cold and Heat waves are characterized as large-scale and non-local extreme
events; therefore, they are detected through a significant number of weather
stations."

The definition of a heat/cold wave varies according to the aims of the studies
and, as a consequence, there are many different ways to identify the events.

> There is a clear indication that there are many ways to identify heat/cold
waves, but there is no consensus about it.

For this study, percentile thresholds were used (10th and 90th) for a 15-day
window in a 56-year reference period. An event is defined if the minimum
(maximum) temperature is bellow (above) the respective threshold for at least
3 days. The reason of 15-day window is because the heat (cold) event can be found
in late spring (autumn).

Duration (D) is the number of consecutive days of the event. Severity (S) is the
absolute value of the sum of temperatures during the event. Mean severity
(characterization of heat/cold events) is the $S/D$. The Intensity is defined as
the mean temperature during the event.

> The equations look a bit weird compared with the description, it is recommended
to check it again.

To analyze the events, a series of metrics where defined and plotted (see
respective table).

## Results and discussion

Since the definition of an event relies on percentile threshold, a heat (cold)
wave can be found in winter (summer), but those are not highly intense. So the
multi-sectoral impact on society is low. However, the events mentioned can have
a consequence over crops that is adapted to specific climate features.

In general, the number of heat (cold) waves increased (decreased) during the
1961-2016 period. The increase (reduction) of heat (cold) waves in Southern
Brazil is lower compared to the other regions. The increase of heat waves was
also found in other studies. Also, the decrease of cold waves is stronger than
the increment in heat waves.

In terms of intensity, cold waves remain almost the same and ¿increased? in the
North and South. Heat waves became more intense.

> The analysis about cold waves does not make sense if one checks figure 4. Check
methodology to understand how the intensity was calculated.

Looking at the stations, there seems to be no change in the intensity trends for
heat and cold waves. The increase in some stations could be related to high
density urban areas.

The mean annual duration of cold waves is higher in tropical areas due to rain.

"The spatial distribution compared between cold and heat waves allowed observing
that the extremes did not show reversed behaviour in most of the country".

## Conclusions

- Although there is an intensification of the extremes, this was found as
  regional patterns. When analyzing the weather stations, very few points showed
  the intensification. Additionally, no extreme meteorological conditions were
  found all over Brazil.

- Heat waves tend to last longer (5 days) compared with cold waves (3 days).
