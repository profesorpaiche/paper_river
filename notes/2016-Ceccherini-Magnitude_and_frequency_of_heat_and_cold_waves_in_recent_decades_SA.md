- Natural Hazards Earth System Sciences
- **Description:** Analysis of heat and cold waves in South America using
  weather stations and analysing how these events change over time.

# Notes

- Extreme heat events (spatially and temporally) are still lacking for S.A. Its
  robust assessment might provide essential information on the climate related
  risks that society now face, and how this risks are changing.

- Events where identified with H/CWMId to weather stations from the GSOD
  database. Trend analysis was done to Tmax, Tmin and thermal range (MTR).
  Couldn't be done to the index because of the change in behavior in the last
  10 years.

- Results from heat wave analysis indicates the presence of an increase of
  intensity and frequency of extreme events in the last 10 years. Results form
  cold waves shows an erratic behavior and no conclusions can be drawn. Heat
  waves shows temporal coherence with El Niño events (especially in Peruvian
  coast), whereas no connection between cold waves and El Niño can be inferred.

- From trend analysis, Tmax is increasing at a rate of 1°C/decade, whereas Tmin
  only increases in the tropics and decreases in extratropics.
