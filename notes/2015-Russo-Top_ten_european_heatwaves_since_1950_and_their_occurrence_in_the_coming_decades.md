  HWMId index and the future projections.

# Notes

## Introduction

- What is cool for some people can be a heat-wave for others, which makes
  difficult the comparison between places.

    - This can be overcome by using percentile or indices taking into account
      the duration as well.

- HWMI index has a problem of over-saturation when there are days with very high
  T°.

    - This research tries to solve that problem with a modified HWMMI index.

- With climate change the heat-waves will be more frequent and with increasing
  area.

## Material & Methods

- Heat-wave magnitude index daily (HWMId). Improved HWMI. Maximum magnitude of
  heat-wave in a year.

- Heat-wave: >= 3 days with Tmax > 1981-2010 threshold.

- Threshold: 90th percentile of Tmax in a 31 day window (climatology of 31 days).

- Magnitude: sum of the magnitude of consecutive days.

    - Based on the 25th & 75th percentile of Tmax.

    - Defined at each location.

- Unit: equivalent to a day with T = T~75p~ and a correspondly anomaly of 1 IQR
  (magnitude of the variability).

- Can be used for Tmin as well.

- HWMI has the problem of saturation by high values. By having and upper limit of
  1, the very strong heat-waves will have values closer to 1 even if the events
  are 5°C stronger. HWMId solves this problem.

- They used gridded observed data and projections from CORDEX.

- They analyze percentual area coverage, PDF & ECDF.

- They checked the uncertainty with bootstrapping and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

- They also have a ranking criteria for the heat-waves.

## Heat-wave ranking since 1950

- The ranking identify events covered by news, which means that it can resemble
  people's feelings.

- Description of some of the events.

## Model evaluation (1981-2010)

- For the models the threshold were based on the model itself and not
  observations to avoid some possible bias from the model. This resulted in
  better skill.

- Were the models able to replicate some of the 1981-2010 events? _I am not sure._

## Heat-waves in the 2 decades

- Probability of experience a major European heat-waves is increasing an is
  longer in RCP 8.5 than 4.5.

- It is difficult to replicate the Russian 2010 event (it has a very high return
  period) but some models project it in the future under RCP8.5.

- 1% level of significance -> the percentage of area will be greater for RCP 4.5
  and even more fore RCP 8.5.

## Conclusions

- Heat-waves that are unusual will become more common and could occur in any
  country of Europe.
