# Notes

In the case of U.S., the estimates of deaths due to extreme heat doubles when
pre-existing health conditions is taken into account.

## Data and methodology

Daily records of emergency department visits across North California for
2007-2011 was used. The diseases analyzed included cardiovascular diseases,
cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and other disorders of the
endocrine, nervous, psychiatric, and renal systems.

To identify a heat event, they relied on the warnings produced by local weather
service offices. They considered the end of an event when the time between
warnings was more than 5 days because the mortality increases dramatically for
events of 5 days or more according to some reference.

To assess the effect of heat waves, they used a case-crossover analysis by
averaging the mean daily ED visits during the events and four control periods for
each event. The control periods were averaged in one control period per event.
Control periods had the same duration, same month, and same distribution of days
as the corresponding heat event.

Although the effects of heat wave on mortality can last for several days or
weeks, the effects on morbidity are often immediate, so there was no need to
analyze lag effects.

A two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare the number of ED visits during
an event against the expected number of visits. This determined whether there was
an excess or deficit number in each health outcome.

## Results and discussion

There is a clear increment of ED visits during a heat event where the most common
diagnosis was heat exhaustion. However, heat stroke showed a low percentage with
no clear explanation.

The elderly was a risk group with a slight increase in heat strokes, whereas the
young population doesn't present a marked increase. For other events, young and
middle age people are the ones with higher amount of visits.

There is also an increase on respiratory diseases, but literature is not abundant
on why there might be a connection. One possibility is due to increase of
pollution during hot events, like ozone.

Renal failure also increased during these events. Nervous system disorders also
increased, but the pathophysiology and their relationship with heat events is not
well documented. Anyway, the author tried to come up with an explanation.
