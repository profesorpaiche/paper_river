  infections in a mountain region in Peru.

# Notes

- The article mentions the use of fire in kitchens to fight against cold
  temperature. _This could be a problem in long-term since the inhalation of
  ashes, CO and CO2 from the fire can cause some chronic lung diseases._

- Weak relationship between acute respiratory infections and maximum
  temperature, and weak inverse relationship with minimum temperature.
  Annually, acute respiratory infections and minimum temperature are coherent
  and in counter-phase. Maximum temperature is also coherent.

- _Analysis is not so convincing._
