- **Description:** Review of several articles related to heat waves to address
  how this are related to health across the globe.

# Notes

- Context for heat waves and temperature trend -> how health can be affected
  _(still not uniform results)_ -> subgroup of people are in more danger
  depending on health pre-conditions and social factors -> Social determinants
  contribute substantially to increased risk, as well as UHI is more common now
  in many growing cities -> Reviews focus the effect of heat waves in different
  ways.

- The review looked for articles that follow specific keywords.

- Almost all studies are located in mid latitudes (North America, Europe,
  China). Reasons why it is lacking in other regions could be: lack of research
  funding, a _dearth_ of researchers located within the study areas, issues
  with data availability.

- Seems like there is an increase of research when a strong event happens.

- Research started in USA, then it move to Europe and now China is producing
  high amount of studies about heat waves.

- Mortality is more studied, but morbidity could be better to asses the impact
  of heat waves.

- More research in wealthy countries (mid latitudes). Tropics are
  under-represented, which are the regions that  will suffer from unsurvivable
  conditions in the future.

- Cities with low summer temperatures are more sensitive to heat waves. This is
  a consequence of aclimatation of people.
